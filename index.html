    <h1>Welcome to <span id="name">Renagen</span>: Pioneering RNA-Targeted Drug Discovery</h1>
    <p>At Renagen, we're leveraging deep learning to unlock the potential of RNA-targeted small molecule drug
        discovery. Our innovative approach aims to overcome traditional challenges in predicting RNA structures,
        offering new pathways to treat diseases at their genetic roots. </p>

    <h3>What is RNA and what does it have to do with drug discovery?</h3>
    RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, a crucial molecule that carries genetic blueprints from DNA to guide protein
    synthesis
    in cells. Its involvement doesn't stop at protein creation; RNA also plays a pivotal role in controlling which genes
    are
    turned on or off in our cells, making it an attractive target for new drug therapies. By designing drugs that can
    specifically target RNA molecules, we open up new possibilities for treating diseases at the genetic level, offering
    a
    broader range of drug discovery opportunities.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <h3>So why does it not exist already?</h3>
    The challenge in leveraging RNA for drug discovery lies in the complexity of predicting RNA structures. RNA
    molecules
    are notoriously difficult to model due to their dynamic and flexible nature. Traditional computational methods have
    struggled because they can't accurately capture the intricate ways RNA folds.
    <br /><br /><br />

    <h3>How do YOU plan to solve this problem?</h3>
    We are developing a deep learning model (think AlphaFold but for RNA!) that can predict RNA secondary structure and
    RNA-ligand interactions with high accuracy. By integrating two types of learning — end-to-end and geometrical
    restraint—our AI tool can potentially predict RNA structures with unprecedented precision, providing a solid
    foundation
    for drug discovery and other scientific inquiries.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <h3>Awesome! Do you have a product already?</h3>
    We are currently in the process of training our model and looking forward to showcasing our v1 model soon. Stay
    tuned!
    <br /><br /><br />
    <h3>Can you tell us more about yourselves?</h3>
    We are a small team of passionate scientists and engineers from MIT and Northeastern University. Our team members
    have
    diverse backgrounds in computational biology, machine learning, and drug discovery.
